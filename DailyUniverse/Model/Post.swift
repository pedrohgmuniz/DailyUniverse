Where they were created is well known: in a binary star system that lies about 6,000 light years away toward the constellation of the Swan (Cygnus) -- a system dominated by the Wolf-Rayet star WR 140.  Wolf-Rayet stars are massive, bright, and known for their tumultuous winds. They are also known for creating and dispersing heavy elements such as carbon  which is a building block of interstellar dust. The other star in the binary is also bright and massive -- but not as active.  The two great stars joust in an oblong orbit as they approach each other about every eight years. When at closest approach, the X-ray emission from the system increases, as, apparently, does the dust expelled into space -- creating another shell.  The featured infrared image by the new Webb Space Telescope resolves greater details and more dust shells than ever before.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2209/WR140_WebbSchmidt_960.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Dust Shells around WR 140 from Webb","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2209/WR140_WebbSchmidt_960.jpg"}
