# DailyUniverse

👷‍♂️🛠 App under construction

iOS App that shows a picture of an astronomical phenomenon and a brief explanation of it everyday.

Daily Universe has three main functionalities:
- Shows one astronomical picture per day, along with its title and a brief explanation of the phenomenon depicted. These elements are presented in the form of a card.
- Allows the user to save a card on the app for accessing it later.
- Allows the user to share the informations in the card on a social media platform.

The data comes from NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) microservice, available as [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/nasa/apod-api).
